This is a lightweight, responsive, Zelda 1 Randomizer web tracker. It was made as an alternative to some of the existing application based trackers in the Z1 community, and was heavily influenced by Z-Tracker, which you can check out here: https://github.com/brianmcn/Zelda1RandoTools If you want to use a desktop application with more tools than what this tracker provides, I highly recommend checking that one out.

This tracker will not be heavily maintained. It was built completely in HTML and JS to allow for novice modifications. If you like what you see but want to add just a little bit more, please feel free to clone and/or fork this project and expand on it. If it is something you would like to have added to the main, put in a PR and I'll take a look. Won't promise anything, but there are some features from Z-Tracker that I would like to implement still.

If you find any game breaking bugs, please contact me via Discord @bigdunka
